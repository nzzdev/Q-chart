# NZZ Storytelling Q Chart

This is Q Chart. It is a hack taking the old Q-chart code and making it work as a service with some server side logic.

## Implementation details
The tool structure follows the general structure of each Q tool. Further information can be found in [Q server documentation - Developing tools](https://nzzdev.github.io/Q-server/developing-tools.html).
